## t64fix

### About

t64fix is a command line tool to verify and optionally fix T64 files, simple containers supported by various Commodore 8-bit machine emulators. The program can also be used to create T64 files from one or more .prg files.

A [T64](http://unusedino.de/ec64/technical/formats/t64.html) file is **not** a proper image of a tape, it's a simple archive format that was created by Miha Peternel for the [C64S](http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/crossplatform/emulators/msdos/c64s/) Commodore 64 emulator. For proper tape emulation, the [TAP](http://unusedino.de/ec64/technical/formats/tap.html) format is the de-facto standard.
